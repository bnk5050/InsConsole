# Insurance Claim Tracking Console
This application is a prototype for an application that helps you track medical claims, ensuring that you're not overpaying for your medical visits. 

I built this application because I had a hard time keeping track of all the medical claims that were made after a significiant hospital visit, such as a delivery, or medical emergency. As an example, my daughter had symptoms of epilipesy and stayed in the hostpial for seven days while being monitored on an EEG. There were over a dozen claims filed with our insurance company, and the deductable was quickly met. Its hard to sort through the sheer number of claims to try to figure out if we were overpaying or being taken advantage of. 

In other events, I've recevied bills from a hosptial for charges that had been paid for by insurance. I've also been billed for charges that should have been paid for my insurance, but were not. We're at a disadvantage. Insurance companies have software systems to support their claims tracking, medical systems have software to send bills and collect money, but we, the little people, don't have the same support to validate what we're being told. This project seeks to change that and empower the people to have a seat at the table of medical and insurance billing.
